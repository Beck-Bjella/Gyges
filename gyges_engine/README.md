# Overview
An incredibly strong Gygès engine.

The Gygès engine is a powerful program designed to play the game of Gygès. Similar to a chess engine, it utilizes advanced algorithms and strategies to make intelligent moves.

The engine communicates using the UGI Protocol, a communication protocol specifically developed for this engine. This protocol is closely related to the UCI Protocol used in chess engines, incorporating similar concepts and ideas. Check out the [UGI Protocol]() for more information.

Please note that the Gygès engine is a standalone application and not intended to be used as a library. If you are looking for a library to integrate Gygès functionality into your own projects, you can find it [here]().

# Installation
To get started with the Gygès engine, you have two options for installation:

- **Executable:** The latest release of the Gygès engine includes a precompiled executable file (.exe) that you can download directly. This is the easiest way to get the engine running quickly.

- **Build from Source:** If you prefer to build the engine from source, you can find the source code in this repository. This option gives you more flexibility and control over the build process, especially if you are using a different architecture than x86-64.

# Usage
There are multiple ways to interact with the Gygès engine:

- **Command Line Interface:** You can communicate with the engine directly through the command line using the UGI Protocol. However, this method is not recommended for most users, as it requires manual input and lacks a user-friendly interface.

- **GygesUI:** For a more convenient user-friendly experience, I recommend using the [GygesUI](https://github.com/Beck-Bjella/GygesUI) user interface. GygesUI provides a graphical interface for interacting with the Gygès engine, making it easier to play the game and explore its features.
