# Overview
An incridbly strong Gyg√®s engine.

The engine is analogous to a chess engine in many ways. The biggest similarity is the way that the engine communicates. The engine communicates using the [UGI Protocol]() which is almost identical to the [UCI Protocol](). Alot of the same ideas and concepts from chess engines were also applied to this engine. 

# Installation
This code is not intended to be used as a library. It is intended to be used as a standalone engine.

- **Executable:** The most recent release includes a precompiled executable (.exe) file for the Gyges engine, which can be downloaded directly.

- **Build from Source:** For users who prefer building from source, the source code is available here. 

# Usage
Check out the [UGI Protocol]() for examples of how to communicate with the engine over the command line.

You can also check out the [Gyges-Game-Analyser]() which is a GUI that can be used to do engine analysis on different positions using this engine. This is the recommended way to use this engine. This is not complete yet, but will be soon.
